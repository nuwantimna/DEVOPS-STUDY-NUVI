Running Terraform across AWS and Azure? This folder structure keeps it clean, repeatable, and ready for scale.

Here’s how it works — and why it matters:

1. Split by provider 
The `multi-cloud-terraform/` folder has separate folders for `aws/` and `azure/`. Each holds its own `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`. This keeps cloud-specific logic isolated.

2. Use modules for reuse 
Inside `modules/`, you define reusable building blocks. For example, `aws/storage/` or `azure/compute/`. These modules reduce duplication and make updates easier.

3. Separate environments 
The `envs/` folder holds `dev/`, `test/`, and `prod/`. Each has its own config for both clouds. This lets you test safely before going live.

4. Backend config per env 
Each environment has a `backend.tf` file. This controls where Terraform stores its state — critical for team collaboration and rollback.

5. Custom variables per env 
The `terraform.tfvars` file lets you set values like region or instance size per environment. No hardcoding needed.

6. Provider setup per env 
Each env also has a `providers.tf` file. This defines credentials and cloud-specific settings, keeping secrets out of shared code.

This setup isn’t just tidy — it’s scalable, secure, and production-ready
